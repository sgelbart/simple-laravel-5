## Option 1: Creating a Project

If you are following along with this as a tutorial (instead of using this github branch) you'll want to create a new project.

Process on Mac Yosemite (though most OS should be similar)

1. Install Composer if you haven't already https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md BE SURE TO INSTALL IT GLOBALLY!
2. In terminal run composer global require "laravel/installer=~1.1"
3. Change to the directory you'd like to create the folder for the project in e.g., cd ~/Web (tip, on Mac you can drag the folder into terminal to get the path)
4. Run laravel new simple-laravel-5 (feel free to replace simple-laravel-5 with whatever name you want)
5. If you're having problems try adding an alias for Laravel using sudo nano ~/.bash_profile then add alias laravel='~/.composer/vendor/bin/laravel' or follow instructions here
